The image with a grid was constructed from the original image provided using GIMP to add the grid overlay.
Using the provided pixel and foot dimensions, I calculated that 31.48 pixels == 1 Foot.
The grid overlaid starts at the 0,0 location in the top left corner set by Path Weaver (74,50) in the JSON config file.
Each grid line is 16 pixels (~6 inches) apart.
